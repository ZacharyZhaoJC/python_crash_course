# Part II: Projects

Part II contains three kinds of projects, and you can choose to do any or all of these projects in whichever order you
like. Here’s a brief description of each project to help you decide which to dig into first.

## Alien Invasion: Making a Game with Python

In the Alien Invasion project (Chapters 12, 13, and 14), you’ll use the Pygame package to develop a 2D game. The goal of
the game is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen, in levels that increase in speed and
difficulty. At the end of the project, you’ll have learned skills that will enable you to develop your own 2D games in
Pygame.

## Data Visualization

The Data Visualization projects start in Chapter 15, where you’ll learn to generate data and create a series of
functional and beautiful visualizations of that data using Matplotlib and Plotly. Chapter 16 teaches you to access data
from online sources and feed it into a visualization package to create plots of weather data and a map of global
earthquake activity. Finally, Chapter 17 shows you how to write a program to automatically download and visualize data.
Learning to make visualizations allows you to explore the field of data science, which is one of the highest-demand
areas of programming today.

## Web Applications

In the Web Application project (Chapters 18, 19, and 20), you’ll use the Django package to create a simple web
application that allows users to keep a journal about different topics they’ve been learning about. Users will create an
account with a username and password, enter a topic, and then make entries about what they’re learning. You’ll also
deploy your app to a remote server so anyone in the world can access it.

After completing this project, you’ll be able to start building your own simple web applications, and you’ll be ready to
delve into more thorough resources on building applications with Django.
