# Part I: Basic Concepts

Part I of this book teaches you the basic concepts you’ll need to write Python programs. Many of these concepts are
common to all programming languages, so they’ll be useful throughout your life as a programmer.

## Chapter 1: Getting Started

In Chapter 1 you’ll install Python on your computer and run your first program, which prints the message `Hello world!`
to the screen.

## Chapter 2: Variables and Simple Data Types

In Chapter 2 you’ll learn to assign information to variables and work with text and numerical values.

## Chapter 3: Introducing Lists

Chapters 3 and 4 introduce lists. Lists can store as much information as you want in one place, allowing you to work
with that data efficiently. You’ll be able to work with hundreds, thousands, and even millions of values in just a few
lines of code.

## Chapter 4: Working with Lists

In Chapter 4 you’ll learn how to loop through lists, modify lists, and organize lists.

## Chapter 5: If Statements

In Chapter 5 you’ll use if statements to write code that responds one way if certain conditions are true, and responds
in a different way if those conditions are not true.

## Chapter 6: Dictionaries

Chapter 6 shows you how to use Python’s dictionaries, which let you make connections between different pieces of
information. Like lists, dictionaries can contain as much information as you need to store.

## Chapter 7: User Input and While Loops

In Chapter 7 you’ll learn how to accept input from users to make your programs interactive. You’ll also learn about
while loops, which run blocks of code repeatedly as long as certain conditions remain true.

## Chapter 8: Functions

In Chapter 8 you’ll write functions, which are named blocks of code that perform a specific task and can be run whenever
you need them.

## Chapter 9: Classes

Chapter 9 introduces classes, which allow you to model real-world objects. You’ll write code that represents dogs, cats,
people, cars, rockets, and more.

## Chapter 10: Files and Exceptions

Chapter 10 shows you how to work with files and handle errors so your programs won’t crash unexpectedly. You’ll store
data before your program closes and read the data back in when the program runs again. You’ll learn about Python’s
exceptions, which allow you to anticipate errors and make your programs handle those errors gracefully.

## Chapter 11: Testing Your Code

In Chapter 11 you’ll learn to write tests for your code, to check that your programs work the way you intend them to. As
a result, you’ll be able to expand your programs without worrying about introducing new bugs. Testing your code is one
of the first skills that will help you transition from beginner to intermediate programmer.
